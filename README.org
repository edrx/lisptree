#+TITLE: Draw Maxima objects as trees (using Lisp)

* Introduction

This is a rewrite of [[http://anggtwu.net/eev-maxima.html#luatree][LuaTree]]. The original LuaTree used [[http://anggtwu.net/luatree/luatree.lua.html][luatree.lua]] to
draw the trees and used [[http://anggtwu.net/luatree/luatree.lisp.html][this Lisp code]] to let Maxima call luatree.lua -
note that it has a line that says "(require :asdf)"... so LuaTree
required Lua, [[https://asdf.common-lisp.dev/][ASDF]], and a Maxima compiled with a Lisp that supported
ASDF; the Maxima that comes with Debian is compiled with GCL, that
doesn't support ASDF - so LuaTree was hard to use.

LispTree is written in just Maxima and Common Lisp, and it should run
in any Maxima.

For htmlized versions of the source files in which all the [[http://anggtwu.net/#eev][eev]]-isms
are hmlized correctly, follow these links: [[http://anggtwu.net/lisptree/lisptree.mac.html][lisptree.mac]],
[[http://anggtwu.net/lisptree/lisptree-middle.lisp.html][lisptree-middle.lisp]], and [[http://anggtwu.net/lisptree/lisptree.lisp.html][lisptree.lisp]].

For more information, see [[http://angg.twu.net/eev-maxima.html#lisptree][my page on Maxima]].

The basic tests are [[http://anggtwu.net/lisptree/lisptree.mac.html#download-test][here]].

If you have Maxima and eev installed you can try LispTree with this
sexp:
